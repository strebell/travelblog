        <h2>Rosemarie Roosevelt</h2>
        <p>I'm Rose, I am 32 years old. Travelling has always been a huge passion of mine. Even as a child we've travelled a lot. Me and my brother were homeschooled because we never knew how long we were going to stay at a certain place. I've already seen so many beautiful places, but I still think there is more to discover. That's why me and my good friend Zoe started this website. We wanted to share our experience with you. So let us in spire you.</p>
        <h2>Zoe Scott</h2>
        <p>My name is Zoe. I'm 29 years old and I grew up in a small town in Utah. Until I went off to college I've never left my State. I've never even been to xxxx. But I always knew, that I wanted to see more. To experience travelling on my own. So thats what I am here for. I want to see the world.</p>
