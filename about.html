        <h2>Our message is simple: "Be who you want to be and travel all around the world!!!"</h2>
        <h4>The first time we met was in the kindergarten where we were best friends from the beginning. Already as little gnomes our 
            mothers noticed that we are little discoverers. On child legs we tried to discover the world how this was possible for two small 
            children. As we got older the world opened up for us in a different way. Soon after it came to our first journey. Who would have
             thought it, meanwhile we were already such a well-rehearsed team that it was foreseeable that we experienced our first common 
             journey together. This was followed by many more exciting and sensational journeys and discoveries. </h4>
