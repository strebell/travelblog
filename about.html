        <h5>Rosemarie Roosevelt</h5>
        <p>I'm Rose, I am 29 years old. Travelling has always been a huge passion of mine. 
            Even as a child we've travelled a lot. Me and my brother were homeschooled because we 
            never knew how long we were going to stay at a certain place. I've already seen so many 
            beautiful places, but I still think there is more to discover. That's why me and my good 
            friend Zoe started this website. We wanted to share our experience with you. So let us in 
            spire you.</p>
        <h5>Zoe Scott</h5>
        <p>My name is Zoe. I'm 29 years old and I grew up in a small town in Utah. Until I went off to college 
            I've never left my State. I've never even been to xxxx. But I always knew, that I wanted to see more. 
            To experience travelling on my own. So thats what I am here for. I want to see the world.</p>

        <h4>The first time we met was in the kindergarten where we were best friends from the beginning. Already as little gnomes our 
            mothers noticed that we are little discoverers. On child legs we tried to discover the world how this was possible for two small 
            children. As we got older the world opened up for us in a different way. Soon after it came to our first journey. Who would have
             thought it, meanwhile we were already such a well-rehearsed team that it was foreseeable that we experienced our first common 
             journey together. This was followed by many more exciting and sensational journeys and discoveries. </h4>
